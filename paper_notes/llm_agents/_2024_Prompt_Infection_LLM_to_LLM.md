**Short Summary:**
This paper introduces Prompt Infection, a attack where malicious prompts self-replicate across interconnected agents, behaving much like a computer virus.

### Contributions

- Prompt Infection, a novel attack where malicious prompts self-replicate across interconnected agents, behaving much like a computer virus

---
### Summary of Strengths

- The concept of prompt infection is simple, yet appears to be effective

---
### Summary of Weaknesses

- The papers mitigation method (LLM Tagging) does not work well.
- The dataset siize is rather low (360) and no standard deviations are shown for the results. It is unclear how representative the findings are, i.e., if the success rate of self-replication really is better than non-replication, especially considering that the sometimes are on par or swapped in performance.

---
### Limitations/Future Work

- 

---
### Notes

- stronger models are harder to jailbreak, but due to their precision are more severe if successful

---
### Important Figures
